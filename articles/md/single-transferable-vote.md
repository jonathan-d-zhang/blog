Single Transferable Vote

Recently, I helped run an election. It was fairly small with just 15 voters, but it was still cool to learn about various voting systems.

## Voting Systems <a id="voting-systems" class="anchor"></a>

A voting system is a set of rules that determine how elections happen. These rules control how many people are elected, how votes are counted, and so on. 

For example, one system is First Past the Post (FPP) (aka single-member plurality voting), which is notably used in the US Presidential Election. FPP is a plurality voting method, which means that in order to win, a candidate needs more votes than all other candidates. Each voter gets one vote.

The only criteria our system needs is to be able to elect multiple people, since we want to have 4 captains.

## Single Transferable Vote <a id="single-transferable-vote" class="anchor"></a>

Luckily, people much smarter than me have already figured out how to do this. Single Transferable Vote (STV) is a kind of "ranked voting", which is any voting system where voters rank the candidates on their ballots. Another kind of ranked voting is called [Instant Runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting), which is used for electing one person. On the other hand, STV is used to elect multiple people, which is good for us.

Now for some vocab. A candidate is **hopeful** if they aren't elected and aren't eliminated. A candidate is **excluded** if they are elected or are eliminated.

In STV, each voter ranks candidates in order of preference. If their preferred candidate is excluded, their vote is transferred to the voter's next choice. This makes sure that votes are not wasted.

The process is divided into rounds. In each round, a candidate might be elected or eliminated. If a candidate receives more than a certain quota, or threshold, of votes, they are elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated.


Let's say for example that we have a group of 20 people, and they want to pick the best 2 programming languages. The choices are Rust (R), Python (P), Kotlin (K), and Go (G). They vote as follows

|  n   | Ordering |
|:----:|:--------:|
|  3   |   P,R    |
|  4   |   R,G    |
|  2   |   K,P    |
|  6   |   R,P    |
|  5   |   G,K    |

The number on the left is how many times the ordering on the right appeared.

First, we need to compute the number of votes needed for a language to be declared a winner. This is calculated by the formula $$q = \lceil N / (W + 1) \rceil $$, where $$W$$ is the number of languages to select and $$N$$ is the number of voters. In our case, $$q = 7$$.

When we sum the first place votes,

| Language | Votes |
|:--------:|:-----:|
|   Rust   |  10   |
|  Python  |   3   |
|  Kotlin  |   2   |
|    Go    |   5   |

we find that Rust has exceeded the quota by a surplus of 3, so Rust is elected.

We now need to evenly distribute these 3 extra votes to the other languages, so they aren't wasted. However, we want to remove any bias involved in selecting which specific ballots are distributed.

To do that, the 3 surplus votes are divided amongst Rust's voters and given to their respective second choice. More specifically, each ballot's weight is multiplied by the "surplus fraction", $$s = \frac{T - q}{T}$$, where $$T$$ is the total number of votes a candidate received.

This way, it doesn't matter who actually cast the extra ballots, since the extras are evenly distributed to each of Rust's voters.

In our case, $$s = \frac{10 - 7}{7} \approx 0.4286$$. Note that we're not flooring or ceiling this; fractional votes are allowed. Of Rust's 10 voters, 4 voted Go second, and 6 voted Python second. So we add $$4s$$ to Go and $$6s$$ to Python. We remove Rust because Rust has already been elected. Since we elected a candidate this round, we don't need to eliminate one.

After distribution, the standings now look like

| Language | Votes  |
|:--------:|:------:|
|  Python  | 5.5714 |
|  Kotlin  |   2    |
|    Go    | 6.7143 |

None of the candidates meet the threshold, so in this round we will eliminate the candidate with the least votes, Kotlin.

Again, we must distribute the votes. This time though, the weight of the votes is not reduced, since all votes are being transferred. Both of Kotlin's voters put Python as their second choice, so we add 2 to Python. Kotlin is eliminated (ðŸ˜­).

The standings are now

| Language | Votes  |
|:--------:|:------:|
|  Python  | 7.5714 |
|    Go    | 6.7143 |

Python exceeds the threshold, so it is elected, and we've chosen our two best languages.

This example doesn't involve a tie, but if that were to happen, we would break the tie with a randomly decided tiebreak order.

## Implementing STV <a id="implementing-stv" class="anchor"></a>

Wow, that was annoying to calculate, huh? Luckily, I know how to program!

In my election, voters used Google Forms to submit ballots, so the data comes in CSV looking something like
```plaintext
"1","2","3","4"
"A","B","E","C"
"B","A","E","D"
"A","F","B","E"
```

This task is perfect for Pandas, so that's what we'll use. Start by doing some initialization: defining constants, loading data, etc.

```py
import math
import random
import pandas as pd

N = 4
candidates = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]

tiebreak_order = random.sample(candidates, k=len(candidates))

winners = []

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
n_voters = len(df)
df = df.assign(weight=[1] * n_voters)

quota = math.ceil(n_voters / (N + 1))

hopefuls = pd.Series(
    data=dict(zip(candidates, [0] * len(candidates)))
).rename("Hopefuls")
firsts = df["1"].value_counts()
hopefuls[firsts.index] += firsts
```

We add a new column, `weight`, to track the weight of each ballot through each round. The `hopefuls` Series will contain the votes of the candidates that aren't yet excluded. We'll mutate this as we move through each round. In our example, voters could only choose 2 languages, so votes could be distributed at most once. For this election though, voters select up to 4 captains, so we need to track the weight of each individual ballot.

Next we need to be able to transfer votes away from winning candidates or eliminated candidates. In our example, though, we didn't encounter the case where we needed to transfer a ballot, but the next candidate on the ballot was excluded.

```py
def transfer_ballots(away_from, eliminate):
   ...
```

The two parameters, `away_from` and `eliminate`, tell us who to transfer ballots away from and whether this candidate is eliminated or elected.

The first thing we need to do is adjust the weight of each ballot. For eliminated candidates, the weight of each ballot stays the same, since all the ballots are transferred. For elected candidates, however, only the surplus ballots are transferred, so we multiply the weight of the ballots by the surplus fraction.
```py
i = 1

away_from_voters = df[str(i)] == away_from

if not eliminate:
    df.loc[away_from_voters, "weight"] *= (surplus.loc[away_from]
        / hopefuls.loc[away_from])
```

We use `i` to keep track of the current column. To transfer the ballots, we must find the next most preferred candidate that has not been excluded, for each of the ballots that voted for `away_from`.

Implementing this in Python is fairly straightforward.

```py
ballots = df.loc[away_from_voters]
while True:
    if i == N:
        break
    
    cur_column = ballots[str(i + 1)]
    not_excluded_candidates = cur_column.isin(hopefuls.keys())
    
    t = ballots.loc[not_excluded_candidates].groupby(str(i + 1)).sum()["weight"]
    hopefuls[t.index] += t
    
    if isin.all():
        break

    ballots = ballots[~not_excluded_candidates]
    i += 1
```

It's a bit much to take in at once, so we'll break it down with an example. Assume that `df` looks something like

| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | weight |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|:------:|
| A   | B   | E   | C   |  0.5   |
| B   | A   | E   | D   |   1    |
| A   | F   | B   | E   |  0.5   |

that `away_from = "A"`, and that we've already excluded F. The ballots we care about are in row `0` and row `2`, so we filter the rest out.

| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | weight |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|:------:|
| A   | B   | E   | C   |  0.5   |
| A   | F   | B   | E   |  0.5   |

We first start by looking at column 2, which would have the ballots' next preferred candidate.

```python
cur_column = ballots[str(i + 1)]
```

Which gives us

| 2   |
|-----|
| B   |
| F   |

We then filter the rows by the candidates that haven't been excluded, or equivalently the candidates that are still hopeful. Summing the weights of these ballots gives us the new votes we need to transfer.

```python
not_excluded_candidates = cur_column.isin(hopefuls.keys())

t = ballots.loc[not_excluded_candidates].groupby(str(i + 1))["weight"]
hopefuls[t.index] += t
```

The first ballot votes for B, who is still hopeful, so this ballot is transferred to B. The second ballot, however, votes for F, who has been excluded.

If all the ballots were transferred, then break. Else, we filter out the ballots that were already transferred, and try the next column.

```python
if isin.all():
    break

ballots = ballots[~not_excluded_candidates]
i += 1
```

On the next iteration, the current column is 3, which is B. This candidate is hopeful, so we can transfer this ballot, and we're done transferring.

We probably shouldn't be mutating global variables in our function, but it works, so whatever.

Now that we can transfer votes, we need to actually run the election.

```py
while len(winners) < N:
    pending = hopefuls.loc[hopefuls >= quota]
    
    if pending.empty:
        # eliminate someone
        ...
    else:
        # elect someone
        ...
```

If `pending` is empty, it means no one was over the quota, so we need to eliminate someone. Since there might be multiple people with the minimum votes, we sort by the candidates' position in `tiebreak_order`.

```py
if pending.empty:
    lowest = sorted(
        hopefuls.loc[hopefuls == hopefuls.min()].keys(),
        key=tiebreak_order.index
    )[0]

    transfer_ballots(lowest, eliminate=True)
    hopefuls.drop(lowest, inplace=True)

    if len(winners) + len(pending) + len(hopefuls) <= N:
        winners.extend(hopefuls.keys())
        break
```

Otherwise, `pending` is not empty, which means someone was over the quota.

```py
else:
    surplus = (pending - quota)

    if len(winners) + len(pending) == N:
        winners.extend(pending.keys())
        break

    highest = sorted(
        surplus.loc[surplus == surplus.max()].keys(),
        key=tiebreak_order.index
    )[0]
    winners.append(highest)

    transfer_ballots(highest, eliminate=False)
    hopefuls.drop(highest, inplace=True)
```

All we have left to do is print the winners,
```py
print(winners)
```
and we're done ðŸŽ‰.

This code probably still has bugs in it; I've already found several while writing this article ðŸ˜¬.
