## What Is Senior Project? <a id="what-is-senior-project" class="anchor"></a>
At my high school, in order to graduate, each senior must complete a Senior Project with the help of a mentor. For 15 days, students do "an experiential exploration of a topic of interest to the individual student".

For my project, I wanted to make a website. Prior to making this blog, I had no experience with web development, so this was a nice way to see what it's like.

I decided to use Rust, because I haven't used it for an actual project yet. The backend framework I used was [rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs/). I used [handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating. It's currently hosted on AWS Lightsail Containers.

## Creating and Reading Articles <a id="creating-and-reading-articles" class="anchor"></a>
The first few days were spent creating the basic routes: reading articles, the home page, etc. These were relatively simple to make; `rocket.rs` made it quite easy.

The articles themselves are stored in a JSON file, along with some metadata. I considered using a database, but decided that since they would mostly be read-only, I didn't have to worry about atomicity issues.

The home page was intended to have a small intro to the blog, and display 3 articles. Compared to the articles page, which would have all the articles. For now though, they look practically identical since I have less than 3 articles.

The process of deploying new articles to the website was not as easy as I thought it would be. I went through a few iterations of how I wanted to get new articles onto the web server. First, I used a form on the website itself to upload articles directly by copying and pasting the text in. The problem with this method was that I had to worry about security, since I only want myself to be able to upload articles. It was also relatively unsophisticated, since I would have to manually back up the articles to git.

The next idea was to not upload through the website, but rather SSH into the web server and copy over the articles. This method bypasses the security issue of the previous method, which is great. The only problem is that you don't have SSH access into Lightsail Containers, so this method can't work.

The method I finally settled on was to simply create a new container with the new article inside, and push that to Lightsail. This method had none of the security issues of the first method, since I offload all secrets management to Github Secrets, and it could be entirely automated with GitHub Actions and Lightsail's CLI. The only annoying thing was writing the entire deployment configuration inline.

```

On startup, the `articles/md` directory is checked for new markdown files. Any new files are compiled and added to `articles/json`.

Adding support for Markdown was quite trivial with the `pulldown-cmark` crate. It only took a few lines (and most of them were optional!).
```rust
let mut options = Options::empty();
options.insert(Options::ENABLE_STRIKETHROUGH);
options.insert(Options::ENABLE_TABLES);
let parser = Parser::new_ext(rest, options);
let mut output = String::new();
html::push_html(&mut output, parser);
```

Adding fonts and css was also relatively easy. I just used `rocket::fs::FileServer` to serve the files, and it Just Worked.
```rust
fn launch() -> _ {
    rocket::build()
        .mount(
            "/",
            routes![index, get_article::article_page, get_article::articles],
        )
        .mount("/styles", FileServer::from(relative!("styles")))
        .mount("/fonts", FileServer::from(relative!("fonts")))
        .attach(Template::fairing())
}
```

## Using Docker <a id="using-docker" class="anchor"></a>

I had never used Docker before, so my first Dockerfiles were quite rudimentary.
```Dockerfile
FROM rust:1.54
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release
CMD ["./target/release/blog"]
EXPOSE 80
```
This was bad for several reasons. First, this image has all the rust tooling needed to compile the project, which is around 5.97 GB ðŸ˜¬. Second, each time I ran `docker build`, everything had to be recompiled, including the dependencies. This led to
```plaintext
PS C:\Users\Bing\code\rust\blog> docker build -t blog .
[+] Building 471.3s (8/8) FINISHED
```
a *very* long wait.

The space issue wasn't *that bad*, but I really wanted to avoid waiting 10 minutes each time I tested a new change.

The next version was much better.
```Dockerfile
FROM rust:1.54 as build

# Create a new empty project
RUN USER=root cargo new --bin blog
WORKDIR /blog

# Copy project manifests
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
COPY Cargo.lock Cargo.lock

# Build dependencies
RUN cargo build --release
RUN rm src/*.rs

# Copy source and build
COPY src src
RUN rm target/release/deps/blog*
RUN cargo build --release

CMD ["./target/release/blog"]

EXPOSE 80
```

In Docker, each command creates a "layer", which is cached. Docker only updates a layer if it's modified. If the `Cargo.toml` is not modified, then the dependencies couldn't have changed, so they don't need to be rebuilt. This reduces the compile time by almost a factor of 10.

I still had the space issue to deal with, which I fixed with a multi-stage build.

```Dockerfile
FROM rust:1.54 as build
# Everything else same as earlier

FROM debian:buster-slim

COPY --from=build /blog/target/release/blog ./app

COPY images /blog/images
COPY styles /blog/styles
COPY fonts /blog/fonts
COPY templates templates
COPY articles articles
COPY Rocket.toml Rocket.toml

CMD ["./app"]

EXPOSE 80
```
Now instead of using having all the dependencies and build tools in the image, I create a new image and only copy what is needed for the app to run. Here's a screenshot showing the difference. `<none>` is the image from the first `Dockerfile`, and `blog` is the image from the last `Dockerfile`

<img src="/images/build-a-blog/docker-images.png" alt="screenshot of docker desktop showing change in docker image size">

After these changes, `docker build` runs much faster (on subsequent runs), and also takes much less space ðŸŽ‰.

## Images <a id="images" class="anchor"></a>
Unfortunately, the syntax for inserting an image and creating a hyperlink in markdown is the same,
```markdown
[image alt text](/cool/image.png)
[link text](https://example.com)
```
so the `pulldown-cmark` parser can't decide if it should make a link or an image, so it defaults to a link. This means I can't embed images with normal Markdown syntax.

There is a workaround, as you might have noticed. I can still insert images by manually typing html tags and linking them to the image. So this "markdown"
```html
<img src="/images/build-a-blog/docker-images.png" alt="...">
```
results in this image

<img src="/images/build-a-blog/docker-images.png" alt="screenshot of docker desktop showing change in docker image size">

Slightly annoying, but oh well.

## Article Previews <a id="article-previews" class="anchor"></a>

For the articles page, I wanted to put a quick intro for each article, using a snippet of the article itself. This was actually pretty annoying (and it still doesn't work that well). Everything happens in this function.

```rust
fn truncate_body(body: &str) -> String {
    // manually iterate instead of using `take(120)` because we want to ignore
    // html tags in our character count
    let first_line = body.splitn(2, '\n').next().unwrap().to_string();
    let mut shortened = Vec::new();
    let mut in_brackets = false;
    let mut i = 0;
    for ch in first_line.trim_end().chars() {
        if i == 120 {
            break;
        }
        // this isn't very robust, but we can just try to avoid writing <>
        // in the first 120 chars
        match ch {
            '<' => in_brackets = true,
            '>' => in_brackets = false,
            _ => {
                if !in_brackets {
                    i += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        shortened.push(ch);
    }

    if shortened.len() < 120 {
        // if it's less than 120 chars, we didn't truncate anything,
        // so we don't need to do any more work
    } else if let Some(i) = shortened
        .iter()
        .rev()
        .position(|&ch| ch == '.' || ch == '!' || ch == '?')
    {
        // truncate to the last complete sentence
        // assume these punctuation marks will end a sentence
        shortened.truncate(shortened.len() - i);
    } else {
        // assume that the first 120 chars are not one big word
        // pop chars until we reach a space
        while let Some(ch) = shortened.pop() {
            if ch == ' ' {
                break;
            }
        }
        shortened.extend("...".chars());
    }

    shortened.into_iter().collect()
}
```

Essentially, this just takes the first line of the article and truncates it to less than 120 chars. This works *ok*, but there are still tons of somewhat avoidable bugs.

I just need to avoid `<` or `>`, codeblocks, and punctuation that isn't an exclamation point, period, or question mark. It's not that bad, but it definitely could be better.

The final result, in my opinion, looks pretty good, so I probably won't fix it until I run into an issue with it.

## Future Optimizations

Throughout the development process, I didn't really care that much about optimizing things. Even so, [Pagespeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsavagepastaman.com%2F&form_factor=desktop) shows that my website is relatively fast, which isn't surprising given that there's almost nothing dynamic happening, but there are still plenty of optimizations I could do.

For one thing, I could reduce the size of my font files. Since I don't need most of the features the fonts have, I could create a font subset. The font I use for the code blocks, Fira Code, would especially benefit from this, since it is almost 500 KB and takes around 100ms to load ðŸ˜¬.

Another thing is that the articles page tries to load *all* the articles at once. This isn't really a problem right now, but if I were to have many more articles, it could potentially be quite slow. This could be solved with pagination, or an "endless scroll" type thing.

For now though, the site is fast enough that it doesn't matter that much.
