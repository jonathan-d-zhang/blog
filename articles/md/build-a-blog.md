Build a Blog

Why do I have a blog? Why does my blog exist?

At my high school, in order to graduate, each senior must complete a Senior Project.
For 15 days, students do "an experiential exploration of a topic of interest to the individual student".

For my project, I wanted to make a website. Prior to making this blog, I had no experience with web development, so this was a nice way to see what it's like.
