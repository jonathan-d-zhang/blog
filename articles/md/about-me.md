About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹. My name is Jonathan. I was born in 2003.

Growing up, I played a variety of sports, like baseball and soccer, but I quickly quit in favor of video games. My friends and I would often play TF2 or CS:GO after school.

My first exposure to programming was in 5th grade, with Hour of Code, which used a block programming language similar to Scratch. I didn't have any interest in programming until high school, when I took a Computer Science course where I was taught Java. In 10th grade, COVID-19 gave me enough free time to pick up Python and Rust. In 11th grade, I took a course where I learned Swift and developed a poorly functioning iOS app.

Throughout high school I competed in various programming competitions, like the USA Computing Olympiad, but I was never that good at competitive programming. I also competed in Science Olympiad, in which you compete in various events with your teammates. I played Ultimate Frisbee for my school team.

Nowadays, I spend a lot of time on the [Python Discord](https://blog.pythondiscord.com/) helping people with their programming problems. I also play a lot of War Thunder.
