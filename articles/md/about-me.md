About Me

Hi. My name is Jonathan. I was born in 2003.

My first exposure to programming was in 5th grade, with Hour of Code, which used a block programming language similar to Scratch.
I didn't have any interest in programming until 9th grade, when I took a Computer Science course where I learned Java.
In 10th and 11th grade, COVID-19 gave me enough free time to pick up Python and Rust.
