About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹. My name is Jonathan. I was born in 2003.

Growing up, I played a variety of sports, like baseball and soccer.

My first exposure to programming was in 5th grade, with Hour of Code, which used a block programming language similar to Scratch.
I didn't have any interest in programming until high school, when I took a Computer Science course where I was taught Java.
In 10th grade, COVID-19 gave me enough free time to pick up Python and Rust. In 11th grade, I took a course where I learned Swift.

Throughout high school I competed in various programming competitions, like the USA Computing Olympiad, but I was never that good at competitive programming.
I also competed in Science Olympiad, in which you compete in various events with your teammates.
